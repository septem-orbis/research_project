like GitHub. However, in the era of big data, the data obtained through these m
ethods has limitations in terms of quality and quantity, and cannot fully captu
re the complexity of coding practices. Further, specific tasks in software engi
neering, such as bug fixing [6] and defect detection [44] of different language

[]\TU/lmtt/m/n/10 However, despite the promising capabilities offered by AI, re
search in this area remains relatively underdeveloped. The prototype developed 
within this study received positive feedback from participants in several key a
reas. Firstly, respondents generally rated the relevance of the generated tags 
highly, with an average rating of 4.4 out of 5. This indicates that the prototy
pe effectively captured the essence of the datasets. Moreover, a significant po
rtion of participants reported that adjusting the "number of keywords" option i
mproved tag relevancy, suggesting flexibility in fine-tuning the tagging proces
s. Additionally, most respondents favored the GPT-4 model for its superior perf
ormance in tag generation compared to GPT-3.5-turbo that was originally selecte
d for its superiority over other LLMs (Section III.C). The superior performance
 of GPT-4 compared to other models aligns with findings from Refuel[]s LLM Labe
ling Technical Report [26], according to which, GPT-4 achieved an average label
 quality score of 0.884 (the percentage agreement with ground truth labels), wh
ereas GPT-3.5 scored 0.813. Additionally, our evaluation of tag relevancy-consi
dering both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4-yielded an average score of 4.4 out of 5, indicat
ing consistency with Refuel[]s findings, though further evaluation with a large
r user base and expanded scope is recommended to substantiate these results. Th
e combination of GPT-4 with five or more keywords emerged as the most effective
 strategy for producing relevant tags consistently. Furthermore, Estonian speak
ers generally expressed satisfaction with the accuracy of the Estonian tag tran
slations. These results are aligned with [26], i.e., TAGIFY being based on LLMs
, can achieve dataset labeling quality comparable to or exceeding that of skill
ed human annotators, while data publishers are often not skilled annotators, bu
t significantly faster and cheaper (e.g., according to [26], ~20x faster and ~7

ness and non-discrimination (100%), human control of technology (69%), professi

 between ethical principles and corporate interests (i.e., profit and sharehold

[]\TU/lmtt/m/n/10 These models generally utilize transformer decoders, while Co
deT5+ [62] retains an encoder-decoder setup. These LLMs excel in program repair
, code generation, and summarization tasks. However, while these models have si
gnificantly enhanced various software engineering tasks, their application in t
he real-world scenario and diverse environments remains challenging [12]. One o
f the key obstacles is ensuring that these models scale effectively across mult
iple domains while safeguarding sensitive data, which is the most important poi
nt for different companies and organizations to join the collaborative communit
y [51]. Before the emergence of LLMs, software engineering primarily applied de
ep learning models in two ways: fine-tuning them [56] in combination with speci
fic tasks or using them as feature extractors without altering their weights. P
ost-LLM, the trend shifted toward contextual learning [55], placing these model
s within broader workflows and integrating domain knowledge for specific scenar
io applications. To better enable LLMs to solve specific tasks in the future, m
ethods based on efficient fine-tuning of additional weights like LoRA [23] have
 gained popularity. These methods also include adapter learning [22], prefix, a
nd prompt learning [26]. Recent empirical studies [39, 40, 68] on LLMs in the s
oftware engineering domain demonstrate how LLMs can reshape methods in the fiel
d. Tools like MetaGPT [20] for automated code generation exhibit the potential 
for automating software development through sophisticated LLM Agents. Such unit
/fuzz testing efforts also employ iterative prompt engineering to generate test
 code [70, 76, 78] and ensure software system quality [60].[]
